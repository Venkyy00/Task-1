🎉 I’m happy to share that I have successfully completed Task 1 of my internship at Apex Planet!
🚀 As part of this task, I built my very first webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
💡 What I worked on:
   ➡️Designed a simple webpage structure with HTML
   ➡️Styled the page with CSS for a clean and modern look
   ➡️Added interactivity using JavaScript (including a working button!)
   ➡️Integrated images, links, and responsive design elements
📚 What I learned:
   ➡️How to combine structure, style, and interactivity to create a functional webpage
   ➡️The importance of clean code and organized design
   ➡️Basics of user experience and making webpages visually appealing

This project may look simple, but it represents the foundation of web development — and I’m excited to keep building on these skills throughout my internship.
